Welcome!

#=======================================================================================
Hello there. I am Nimrod, I am a Physicist and a theoretical neuroscientist, currently a Swartz postdoctoral fellow at 
Harvard center for brain science. I model learning and memory in neural networks, and I love complex, stochastic and 
chaotic systems. In addition to writing simulations, I enjoy desert hikes, biking, cooking and reading (mostly science 
fiction).

#============================================
Here you can find information about my research interest and projects.
